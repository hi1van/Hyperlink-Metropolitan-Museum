# The Hyperlink Metropolitan Museum
Ever wanted to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Look no further.

Visit the live website here: https://www.hypermetmuseum.art

## Project Background
The Hyperlink Metropolitan Museum is designed so that you can explore the renowned exhibitions of the MET in a purpose-built virtual experience. In real life, it is easy to find yourself lost in the maze countless rooms of art displays, 
and I aimed to deliver the same, but online - find yourself lost in the endless web pages, where each page is its own display.

The experience should also be an educational and enlightening one. Accompanying artworks are Wikipedia extracts and links to artist and artwork Wikipedia pages for further reading (if available). As with real-world museums, you have your very own guide who is there to answer whatever questions you may have to do with the art you are viewing.
