Ever wanted to visit the world renowned Metropolitan Museum of Art?

Well today and any day is your lucky day!


The Hyperlink Metropolitan Museum is designed so that you can get lost in the endless exhibitions of the MET. In real life, it is easy to get lost in the countless rooms of art displays, 
and here is no different - get lost in the endless web pages, where each page is its own display.

In it's current state, you can look at any "highlight" piece from any department. 

What's next for the Hyperlink Metropolitan Museum?

- Expand on the "hyperlink" aspect to it - allow the user to choose their own path as opposed to displays being random in order.
- Allow the user to explore a smaller subset of the art pieces at their own choosing - eg. allow them to explore artworks.
- Incorporate art descriptions into the display pages for a more educational/enlightening experience. 

This project has not been deployed and is still a work in progress. However, you can run it on your local machine.
